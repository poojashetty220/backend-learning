# Query Performance Analysis and Optimization for route.get('/')

## 1. Running explain() on the aggregation pipeline

To analyze the performance of the aggregation pipeline used in the route.get('/'), you can run the following code snippet in a MongoDB shell or in your Node.js environment:

```js
const pipeline = [
  { $match: filter },
  {
    $facet: {
      users: [
        { $sort: { [sortField]: sortDirection } }
      ],
      stats: [
        {
          $group: {
            _id: null,
            averageAge: {
              $avg: {
                $cond: [
                  { $ne: ['$age', null] },
                  {
                    $convert: {
                      input: '$age',
                      to: 'int',
                      onError: null,
                      onNull: null
                    }
                  },
                  null
                ]
              }
            },
            totalCount: { $sum: 1 }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
];

// Run explain on the aggregation pipeline
const result = await User.aggregate(pipeline).explain('executionStats');
console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
```

This will provide detailed execution stats and help identify slow stages or collection scans.

## 2. Schema Improvement: Change age field type

Currently, `age` is stored as a String, which requires conversion in queries and prevents index usage. Change the schema to:

```js
age: { type: Number, required: true }
```

This allows direct numeric comparisons and indexing.

## 3. Index Recommendations

Create the following indexes to optimize filtering and sorting:

- Multikey index on addresses.city:

```js
db.users.createIndex({ "addresses.city": 1 });
```

- Indexes on fields used for sorting:

```js
db.users.createIndex({ name: 1 });
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 });
db.users.createIndex({ created_at: 1 });
```

- Text index for efficient text search on name, email, and gender:

```js
db.users.createIndex({ name: "text", email: "text", gender: "text" });
```

## 4. Query Update for Text Search (Optional)

If text index is created, update the search filter in the route to use `$text`:

```js
if (search) {
  filter.$text = { $search: search.toString() };
}
```

This is more efficient than regex on multiple fields.

Implementing these changes will improve query performance by enabling index usage and reducing expensive operations like conversions and regex scans.
